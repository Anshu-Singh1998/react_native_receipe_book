This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!




   ## Features of the Recipe App
## Home Screen
The home screen displays a list of recipes. Each recipe is shown in a card format. Clicking on any recipe card navigates the user to the details screen, where all the information related to the recipe is displayed.

## Recipe Details Screen
On the recipe details screen, users can see all the details about the selected recipe. There is an "Add to Favourites" button which, when pressed, shows an alert indicating that the recipe has been added to the favourites screen.

## Favourites Screen
Users can navigate to the favourites screen by first clicking the back arrow button from the header and then the favourite tab. The favourites screen displays a list of favourite recipes. Each favourite recipe card also has a "Remove" button which, when clicked, removes the recipe from the favourites.

## Navigation
For navigation, React Navigation is used. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and set up.

## Styling
For styling purposes, StyleSheet has been used. This ensures that styles are organized and can be reused across different components.

## State Management
For state management, Redux Toolkit is utilized. This provides a robust solution for managing the app's state, particularly for handling the list of favourite recipes.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
